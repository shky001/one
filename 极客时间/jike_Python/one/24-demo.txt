You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill the void. Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You’re gonna love it!

I thought that it (propose) mattered what I said or where I said it. 

Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.

If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I ... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. 

If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.

Monica, I thought this (getting married) was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna have to do. 

But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was.

I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.

I say more sumb things before 9 am than most people say all day.

Ah, humor based on my pain.

No uterus, no opinion.

I have to go before I put your head through a wall.

You know, like a cow’s opinion. It doesn’t matter. It’s moo.

Your love is like a giant pigeon crapping on my heart.
